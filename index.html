                <h3>Nakamura, Caruana Advance To Champions Open Final</h3>
                <p>American numbers one and two, GMs Hikaru Nakamura and Fabiano Caruana, will clash in the Open Champions Final of The American Cup 2025. Nakamura advanced after scoring a classical win with Black against GM Leinier Dominguez, while it took Caruana two sets of blitz tiebreaks to defeat GM Levon Aronian 3.5-2.5. IM Alice Lee staved off a dangerous attack by GM Irina Krush to draw and advance to the Women's American Cup Champions Final. She will face WGM Tatev Abrahamyan, who defeated IM Carissa Yip in tiebreaks after losing the classical game. Day five of The American Cup will be on Wednesday, March 19, starting at 12:00 p.m. CDT / 17:00 CET / 9:30 p.m.</p>
                <p>Last year's champion, Aronian, did not make it to the Champions Final this year. Instead, we will have a clash of the top two Americans.</p>
                <p>Nakamura won in the classical portion, while Caruana and Aronian had a much longer match. After a draw in classical, it took four blitz games for Caruana to defeat Aronian for the first time in The American Cup since 2022.</p>
                <p>Four days in, Nakamura is the first player to win a classical game in the Open tournament. He won a long, 72-move maneuvering game in the Italian Opening, but one that exploded with tactics at the end. He explained: Today's game was an interesting battle in the opening. I think both of us were a little bit confused. I thought what Leinier did with this whole Be6 and c3 is not supposed to be particularly good, but on the other hand when I played d5 and Nd7 he had this look on his face like he thought I made a mistake.</p>
                <p>Nakamura then said that Dominguez relaxed a bit too much in the middlegame and allowed "this pawn on a5 and grip on the queenside." He thought Dominguez's decision to trade bishops later on was "just an insane move to play." Indeed, Nakamura had an advantage, and he did miss an immediate win with 39...Nxb3!. But he made up for it later in the game, finding a similar tactic with 53...Nxd3! to put away the game.</p>
