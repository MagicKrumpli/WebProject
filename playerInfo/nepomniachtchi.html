                    <h3>Bio:</h3>
                    <p id="bio"> GM Ian Nepomniachtchi (“Nepo” for short) is a Russian super grandmaster who has twice won the Candidates Tournament to play for the world championship. After winning the 2020-21 Candidates Tournament, he challenged GM Magnus Carlsen for the 2021 World Championship and lost in 11 games.

                        Nepomniachtchi then won the 2022 Candidates Tournament and ultimately faced then fell in tiebreaks to GM Ding Liren in 2023 World Championship. Unfortunately, a bid at a third straight Candidates Tournament victory in 2024 was unsuccessful, but Nepomniachtchi remains one of the game's finest players. In 2024, he won the World Blitz Championship for the first time, sharing the title with Carlsen. In the opening, Nepomniachtchi almost always begins with 1.e4 as White with some English (1.c4). As Black, he typically plays the Sicilian with an occasional French against 1.e4, and the Grunfeld is his main weapon against 1.d4. In the 2021 World Championship, Nepomniachtchi changed his openings with Black, responding to 1.e4 with 1...e5 instead of 1...c5.

                        His middlegame is generally marked by an attacking style, which is perhaps best demonstrated by this game from the 2017 Grand Prix at Sharjah. Nepomniachtchi is also a strong player in rapid and blitz games, where the ability to attack and force difficult decisions for the defender is paramount. He has finished second at the World Rapid Championship three times in addition to his shared victory at the 2024 World Blitz Championship. Nepomniachtchi was born in Bryansk, Russia, a city of about half a million population approximately 400 km southwest of Moscow. He played chess from a very young age, about four, and won three straight European championships in his age group from 2000-02.

                        In 2002 he also won the World Junior Championship for players under 12 years old, barely edging out Carlsen, whom he outrated at that point. In 2021 Nepomniachtchi would become the second player, after GM Sergey Karjakin, to win both the Under-12 World Championship and the World Championship Candidates tournaments. Nepomniachtchi continued to improve, gaining about 100 rating points every two years. Quite literally every two years: He achieved 2400 for the first time in April 2003, 2500 in April 2005, and 2600 in the same month in 2007. He also achieved all three of his GM norms in 2007 to obtain that title after having made IM in 2004. April continued to be a good month for Nepomniachtchi in 2008 when he reached the world’s top-100 ratings. He then turned 18 years old in July. </p>
