                        Indian GM Gukesh Dommaraju is the current world chess champion, defeating GM Ding Liren in the FIDE World Championship on December 12, 2024. He is the youngest undisputed world champion in chess history, at 18 years and six months old, shattering the previous record of 22 years and seven months which was set by GM Garry Kasparov in 1985. Gukesh became the challenger to the world championship in April 2024 by winning the 2024 FIDE Candidates Tournament with a score of 9/14, which also made him the youngest-ever Candidates Tournament winner.
                        
                        A chess prodigy, Gukesh earned the GM title at 12 years, 7 months and 17 days of age—narrowly missing GM Sergey Karjakin’s record at the time by 17 days. In July 2022, he achieved a live rating of 2700, the fourth-youngest player to ever do so. In September 2023, he was ranked eighth in the world and first in India—ending GM Viswanathan Anand's 37-year reign as India's top-rated player. Gukesh learned to play chess when he was seven years old. It’s rather late compared to other prodigies. For example, two of the most famous chess sensations in history, GMs Karjakin and Magnus Carlsen, both learned how when they were five years old. Some learn even earlier.

                        Nevertheless, Gukesh, who hails from Chennai, India—the same city as GM Viswanathan Anand—can partly thank his environment for thriving so early. He was introduced to chess by his school, which is part of the Velammal group of schools across Chennai responsible for talents like GMs Murali Karthikeyan, Aravindh Chithambaram and, most famously, Praggnanandhaa R. Gukesh’s first coach at the school, Mr. Bhaskar, helped the youngster become a FIDE-rated player within six months of learning the game.
                        
                        Two years later, while being trained by Mr. Vijayanand, Gukesh found success at the international level. At the 2015 Asian School Chess Championships, he won the under-9 section and also earned the candidate master (CM) title. Gukesh topped his first major win with plenty of success in 2018. At the Asian Youth Chess Championships, he won five gold medals: under-12 individual classical, under-12 individual rapid and blitz, and under-12 team rapid and blitz. Even more important in the same year, Gukesh captured the under-12 title at the World Youth Championships with 10/11 points.</p>
