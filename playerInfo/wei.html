                    <h3>Bio:</h3>
                    <p id="bio"> Chinese GM Wei Yi is an elite player and one of the greatest chess prodigies in history. At the age of 15, he broke GM Magnus Carlsen’s record for the youngest player to reach a rating of 2700, which Wei still holds. Two years prior, he became the fourth-youngest GM in history at the time (now the eighth-youngest GM ever). And from January 2015 to the end of his candidacy as a junior (in late 2019), Wei ranked first or second on FIDE’s list of the top-100 juniors.

                        Since February 2017, he has been ranked in the top 30 players in the world. In January 2024, he cracked the top ten for the first time after winning the Tata Steel Tournament. Wei has a flair for aggressive, tactical positions. The following game represents just how dangerous he can be. In the Berlin Defense of the Spanish, Wei develops a dangerous attack in an opening known to be relatively drawish and stale. He sacrifices a knight to take down talented GM David Navara. Another game showcases Wei’s brilliant attacking prowess. He dismantles young WGM Anne Haast’s position in a wild, exciting game. Wei is dangerous in any facet of the game. Some of his greatest games come when he has the initiative. Take a look at his “immortal” game of sorts in 2015, below, for a true masterpiece.</p>
