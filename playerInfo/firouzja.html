                    <h3>Bio:</h3>
                    <p id="bio"> Alireza Firouzja is an Iranian-born grandmaster who now plays for France. He is a two-time world championship candidate and two-time Iranian champion.

                        In late 2019 and early 2020, Firouzja electrified the chess world with his second place finish in the World Rapid Championship (one point behind World Champion GM Magnus Carlsen) and his amazing 5/7 start at the 2020 Tata Steel tournament. 
                        
                        Firouzja's trajectory continued to shoot up in 2021, when he won the Riga Grand Swiss, scored 8/9 and the European Team Championships, and skyrocketed to #2 in the world rankings with a 2804 rating. His Grand Swiss victory qualified Firouzja for the 2022 Candidates Tournament at the age of 18, one of the youngest ever to achieve that feat, and Firouzja also broke the record for youngest player to surpass a 2800 rating. Firouzja learned how to play chess at the age of eight, and within a few years, it was clear that he was a prodigy. In 2015 he won the gold medal for the under-12 section of the Asian Youth Chess Championship. In 2016 Firouzja became the youngest Iranian chess champion (at the age of 12) and also earned the International Master title. In the following game the 12-year-old Firouzja calmly outplays the strong and experienced GM Pavel Tregubov (former European champion). After a quiet opening, Firouzja secures a positional advantage with 17. Rc5 and then converts this positional advantage to a material advantage through a small combination. Firouzja displays fantastic technique and wins a second pawn on move 37 to bring home the full pointâ€”even at age 12, Firouzja made extremely difficult tasks look easy!</p>
