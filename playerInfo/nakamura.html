                    <h3>Bio:</h3>
                    <p id="bio"> Hikaru Nakamura was born December 9, 1987 in Hirakata, Japan. His family moved to the United States when he was just two years old, and the Stars and Stripes are the only national banner he has known as a chess player. 

                        Nakamura has been one of the world’s top players for well over a decade. He was clearly the top American player for much of that time and is now a key contributor to one of the strongest chess scenes in the world.
                        
                        He is a five-time U.S. champion, claiming the title in 2005, 2009, 2012, 2015, and 2019. Nakamura was also a participant in FIDE’s 2004 World Championship tournament and a candidate for the world championship in both 2016 and 2022, qualifying for a third in 2024. He was also the 2022 Fischer Random World Champion. Nakamura became a national master (USCF) in 1998, an international master in 2001, and grandmaster in 2003. At the time, he was the youngest American grandmaster since Fischer.

                        In 2003 he participated in his first U.S. Championship tournament, scoring +3 -1 =5 in the event, which was won by GM Alexander Shabalov. In January 2004, Nakamura played in Group B at the Corus tournament and finished fourth with a plus score on his way to crack the 2600 rating threshold in June. By October, he was in the world’s top 100 for the first time.
                        
                        He achieved the 2600 mark during FIDE’s 2004 knockout tournament to determine its champion. As the 83rd seed, Nakamura defeated higher-rated opponents GMs Sergei Volkov, Aleksej Aleksandrov, and Alexander Lastin to become one of the last 16 players. In that round, he fell to third seed and eventual finalist Michael Adams, who entered the tournament with a 150-point rating advantage. </p>
