                    <h3>Bio:</h3>
                    <p id="bio"> Nodirbek Abdusattorov is an Uzbek grandmaster who won the 2021 World Rapid Championship and played on the first board for team Uzbekistan that won the 44th FIDE Chess Olympiad. He did both when 17 years old, becoming the youngest player ever to do so. In March 2024, he climbed all the way to fourth in the world in live FIDE rating.

                        Abdussatorov's first major success was the 2012 World Youth Championships Under-8 division, which he won. Two years later, at the age of nine, he defeated two GMs, Andrey Zhigalko and Rustam Khusnutdinov, in a single tournament. On the FIDE April 2015 rating list, the 11-year-old prodigy set a record by becoming the youngest player to enter the top-100 juniors. Abdusattorov earned his first GM norm at the 2016 Mikhail Chigorin Memorial Tournament and second at the Abu Dhabi Masters 2017. In October 2017, he won the third and last norm at the 2017 Mikhail Chigorin Memorial Tournament and became the second youngest grandmaster at that time. He still remains in the top-10 of the youngest grandmasters in chess history. Abdusattorov played for Volga Stormbringers in PRO Chess League seasons 2018 and 2019. His game vs. GM Zaven Andriasian was chosen by the fan vote as the best in the first round of the 2019 season. Abdusattorov qualified via the Speed Chess Championship Grand Prix for the 2020 Speed Chess Championship and lost to GM Wesley So in the first round.  

                        His game vs. GM Shakhriyar Mamedyarov in one of the SCC Grand Prix legs was commentated live by GM Simon Williams.</p>
