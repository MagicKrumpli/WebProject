                    <h3>Bio:</h3>
                    <p id="bio"> GM Praggnanandhaa Rameshbabu is an Indian grandmaster who had one of the greatest youth careers in chess history. Praggnanandhaa, who only turned 18 years old in 2023, is one of the youngest grandmasters and world championship candidates ever. He is the first of a historic quartet of contemporary young Indian players—that also includes GMs Gukesh D, Arjun Erigaisi, and Nihal Sarin—to qualify for the Candidates Tournament, doing so months before Gukesh qualified for the same 2024 Candidates.

                        In 2025, Praggnanandhaa won the prestigious Tata Steel Chess Tournament in a playoff over Gukesh.
                        
                        The player's full name is Praggnanandhaa Rameshbabu and they confirmed to Chess.com that they preferred to be called by their first name, Praggnanandhaa. Praggnanandhaa climbed his way up through the professional ranks largely in the World Youth Championships, where he won the under-8 age group in 2013 and the under-10 group in 2015. Soon after, he became an international master at age 10, the youngest ever at the time by over a year. It took him only about four months to achieve all his requirements. Reasonably enough, grandmaster took a little longer. But not much longer: When Praggnanandhaa achieved the title at 12 years, 10 months, and 13 days of age, he was the second-youngest ever. As of October 2023, he is still one of only five players to become a grandmaster before becoming a teenager.

                        In 2019, Praggnanandhaa won the Under-18 age group at the World Youth Championships when he was not yet even 14 years old. On the November 2019 FIDE rating list that immediately followed, Praggnanandhaa's 2586 rating was 24th among juniors (age 20 and below), and no one above him was younger.
                        
                        That same year, the 13-year-old prodigy also won the Xtracon Chess Open with an undefeated 8.5/10 points, overtaking a field featuring 13 GMs ranked over 2600.</p>
